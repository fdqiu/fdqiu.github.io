I'm a software engineer with interests across data analysis, security, machine learning, virtualization, kernel, and networking. I received my Ph.D. on computer science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2017 under supervision of Prof. Guihai Chen and Prof. Fan Wu, and B.E. from department of Computer science and technology at Xi'an Jiao Tong University in 2012. I visited University of California at Los Angeles in 2015 as a visiting scholar supervised by Prof. Songwu Lv.
